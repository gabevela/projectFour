## Once you sign up, you may select an option from the drop down menu on the left hand side of the app:
<br>

- Post Ad - this option allows for logged in users to create and post an ad which will be available to other logged in users.

- Search by Categories - this option will allow a user to filter their search by fruit and vegetable categories

- My Cart - click here to visit your logged in user's cart. You can checkout after adding items to your cart. 

Note: Once a user checks out the items in their cart, these items are no longer available to other users as the ad is deleted from the database.
